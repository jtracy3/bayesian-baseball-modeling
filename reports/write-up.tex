\section{Markov Chain Monte Carlo}

Markov chains are discrete sequences of numbers such that $p(x_n | x_{n-1}, x_{n-2}, ...x_2, x_1) = p(x_n | x_{n-1})$. Markov chains are named such because they exhibit the Markov property. Derived by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, the Markov property refers to the memorylessness of a stochastic procces. That is, the probability of state $x_n$ is dependent on only the previous state $x_{n-1}$. You only need to know the current state to predict the subsequent state. Knowing the past history of states won't provide additional information regarding any future state.
